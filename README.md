# LaunchDarkly sample TypeScript Node.js (server-side) application

We've built a simple console application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works.

â€¨Below, you'll find the build procedure. For more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart#/) or the [Node.js (server-side) reference guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/node-js).

The LaunchDarkly server-side SDK for Node.js is designed primarily for use in multi-user systems such as web servers and applications. It follows the server-side LaunchDarkly model for multi-user contexts. It is not intended for use in desktop and embedded systems applications.

For a sample application demonstrating how to use LaunchDarkly in *client-side* Node.js applications, refer to our [Client-side Node.js SDK sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-node-client).

## Build instructions

1. Install the LaunchDarkly Node.js SDK by running `npm install`
2. Edit `index.ts` and set the value of `sdkKey` to your LaunchDarkly SDK key. If there is an existing boolean feature flag in your LaunchDarkly project that you want to evaluate, set `featureFlagKey` to the flag key.

```js
  const sdkKey = "1234567890abcdef";

  const featureFlagKey = "my-flag";
```

3. Run `npm start`
